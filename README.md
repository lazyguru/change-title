# Change Title

This is just a quick and dirty react+vite+express JS app to display a form that allows editing the value stored in a text file. To test:

- Clone repo
- Create a file at $HOME/some/path/to/streamTitle.txt
  - Or edit main.js and change the value of STREAM_TITLE_FILE
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- Open [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/)
- Change the value in the field and click "save"
